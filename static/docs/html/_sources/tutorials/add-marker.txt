Tutorial - Adding a Marker
==========================

.. note:: Adding a marker requires the project-level permission "Add Project Data".  See :doc:`../permissions`

#.  Login to the ReFlow server.

#.  From the ReFlow home page, navigate to the project by clicking on the project link.

#.  From the project detail page, click the **Add Marker** link located under the **Markers** heading.

    .. note:: Markers can also be added from the **Marker** list page by clicking on the **Add Marker** button located near the upper right of that page (beside the main heading).

#. A new modal window will appear displaying the form fields.

#.  Fill out the form fields. Note, **Abbreviation** is required and a project cannot have duplicate marker abbreviations. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If possible, avoid spaces in marker abbreviations and try to keep them as succinct as possible. It is recommended to use commonly used abbreviations (e.g. CD3 or IFNg).

       If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new marker is created, the modal window will close.
