    .. note:: Sites can also be added from the **Site** list page by clicking on the **Add Site** button located near the upper right of that page (beside the main heading).

#. A new modal window will appear displaying the form fields.

#.  On the site form, enter the site name in the required **Site Name** field. A project cannot have duplicate site names. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new site is created, the modal window will close.
