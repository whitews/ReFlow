Tutorial - Adding a Subject
===========================

.. note:: Adding a subject requires the project-level permission "Add Project Data".  See :doc:`../permissions`

#.  Login to the ReFlow server

#.  From the ReFlow home page, navigate to the project by clicking on the project link.

#.  From the project detail page, click the **Add Subject** link located under the **Subject** heading.

    .. note:: Subjects can also be added from the **Subject** list page by clicking on the **Add Subject** button located near the upper right of that page (beside the main heading).

#. A new modal window will appear displaying the form fields.

#.  On the subject form, fill out the relevant fields. Note the **Subject Code** field is required and a project cannot have duplicate subject codes. The **Subject Group** field is optional, but can be useful to group subjects and filter samples. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new subject is created, the modal window will close.
