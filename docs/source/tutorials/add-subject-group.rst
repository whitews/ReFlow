#.  Fill out the form fields. Note, subject group **Name** is required and a project cannot have duplicate subject group names. The description field is optional. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new project is created, the modal window will close and the project list will automatically update showing the new project.
