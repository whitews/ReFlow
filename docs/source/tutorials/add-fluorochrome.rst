Tutorial - Adding a Fluorochrome
================================

.. note:: Adding a fluorochrome requires the project-level permission "Add Project Data".  See :doc:`../permissions`

#.  Login to the ReFlow server.

#.  From the ReFlow home page, navigate to the project by clicking on the project link.

#.  From the project detail page, click the **Add Fluorochrome** link located under the **Fluorochromes** heading.

    .. note:: Fluorochromes can also be added from the **Fluorochrome** list page by clicking on the **Add Fluorochrome** button located near the upper right of that page (beside the main heading).

#. A new modal window will appear displaying the form fields.

#.  Fill out the form fields. Note, **Abbreviation** is required and a project cannot have duplicate fluorochrome abbreviations. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If possible, avoid spaces in fluorochrome abbreviations and try to keep them as succinct as possible. It is recommended to use commonly used abbreviations (e.g. APC or FITC).

       If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new fluorochrome is created, the modal window will close.
